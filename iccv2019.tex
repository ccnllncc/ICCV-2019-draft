%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Visual Question Answering (\vqa) is of great significance in offering people convenience: one can raise a question for details of objects, or high-level understanding about the scene, over an image. 
This paper proposes a novel method to address the \vqa problem. In contrast to prior works, our method that targets single scene \vqa, replies on graph-based techniques and involves reasoning. In a nutshell, our approach is centered on three graphs. The first graph, referred to as inference graph $G_I$, is constructed via learning over labeled data. The other two graphs, referred to as query graph $Q$ and entity-attribute graph $\eag$, are generated from natural language query $\nlq$ and image {\cal I}mg, that are issued from users, respectively. As $\eag$ often does not take sufficient information to answer $Q$, we develop techniques to infer missing information of $\eag$ with $G_I$. Based on $\eag$ and $Q$, we provide techniques to find matches of $Q$ in $\eag$, as the answer of $\nlq$ in {\cal I}mg. Unlike commonly used 
\vqa methods that are based on end-to-end neural networks, our graph-based method shows well-designed reasoning capability, and thus is highly interpretable. We also create a dataset on soccer match (Soccer-VQA) with rich annotations. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art method and has high potential for future investigation.
