\section{Experimental Studies}
\label{sec-expt}

In this section, we conducted two sets of experiments to evaluate (1) the performance of our visual processing module, (2) the accuracy of our inference module, and (3) the overall performance of our approach. 

\stitle{Experimental Setting}. %We report settings of experimental studies. 

\etitle{DataSet}. We used two datasets: (1) \kw{Soccer} dataset that we annotated; and (2) X dataset from~\cite{}. We extracted images with subjects of golf and tennis (report Statistics about the dataset). We split \kw{Soccer} (resp. X) data into two parts:{\em  I} (one third) and {\em II} (two thirds), and used {\em II} as training data, and {\em I} as testing data. 

\etitle{Queries}. We used two sets of questions: (1) the set of questions given in Table~\ref{table:questions} for \kw{Soccer} dataset; and (2) another set of questions listed in Table~\ref{} for X dataset.
