%In this paper we propose an innovative approach for visual query answering task. Differentfrom end-to-end neural network based system, our approach reconstructs inputs as entity-attribute graph and pattern query, based on imageImgand question,respectively. Moreover, the answer is found by graph matching. Reinforcement learning is adopted in our approach to identify optimal policies for guiding visual tasksand to select corresponding pattern query. Last but not the least, our approach is able to reason missing information which is crucial for question answering. Experimental results show that the accuracy of our approach reasonably out performs state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed approach is able to balanceeffectiveness and efficiency.


In this paper, we proposed an innovative and efficient approach to handle the \vqa problem. In the proposed method, the image and question are converted to entity-attribute graph and pattern query, respectively. Then, the reinforcement learning technique is utilized to select the pattern query that is helpful to the visual tasks, in which the missing attributes are inferred by the inference graph constructed from a Bayes network. Last but not the least, the answer is found by graph matching.
The generalization of the proposed scheme is significantly improved by introducing the reinforcement learning and inference graph. 
More importantly, the inference graph here is used in a novel way to make the graph works adaptively. 
To be specific, the low-level but unknown information is inferred from the known attributes by the inference network, and the high-level but unknown information is finally inferred when the unknown attributes are well inferred.
The experimental results encouragingly demonstrate that the proposed scheme corroborates the efficiency and high accuracy when compared with other state-of-the-art baseline methods on two data sets.

%%The community has study the problem of \vqa many years, 
The problem of \vqa has been widely studied using the graph manner but with slight satisfaction. 
The reason may concern the integration of external data with complex reasoning tasks, the improvement of inference scheme, and the interactive strategy.
